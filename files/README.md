# Files

This is the root for the arbitary (non-src) files for the workshop. It is split into the five work packages. There are no rules as yet.
Edit as required and for your own structure within your workpackage.
Documentation should reside in the github wiki - not here. This is for other types of information which can be linked to from within the wiki.

e.g. images, data files (keep small - not for datasets!), etc.
