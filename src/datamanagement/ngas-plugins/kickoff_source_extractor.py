"""
Plug-in to kick off the source extractor pipeline once a piece of data has
been received. The current initial version of the plug-in uses a configurable
list of file_ids to filter files that do not need to be source-extracted,
and a configurable command line. The command line specification can use the
'%s' string, which will be replaced with the file_id.

For example, this can be configured under ArchiveHandling as such:

```
   <EventHandlerPlugIn Name='kickoff_source_extractor.SourceExtractorKickOff'
     PlugInPars="command=kickoff.sh:-f:%s, file_ids=file1.id:file2.id:file3.id"/>
```
