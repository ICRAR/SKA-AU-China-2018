Datasets for use with pipeline tests
------------------------------------

Description: This file lists the NGAS file IDs for datasets needed to run the various pipeline tests

Simple Selavy test : 
 - singleSource.fits  (simulated image with a single component at the centre)
 
ASKAP Selavy test :
 - observations-2338-image_cubes-image.i.SB1934.cont.restored.fits
 - observations-1934-image_cubes-image.i.SB1934.cont.restored.fits (as an alternative)

ASKAP imaging test :
(These files are measurement sets, and will need to be un-tarred prior to use)
 - singleSource_Continuum.ms.tar (simulated single-source image observation)
    - inflates to singleSource_Continuum.ms
 - observations-2338-measurement_sets-44.tar  (ASKAP observation - single beam continuum measurement set)
    - inflates to scienceData_SB2338_NGC7232_A_T0-0A.beam00_averaged_cal.ms
 
MWA flagging test:
 - Nothing there so far - will perhaps add something manually from disk
