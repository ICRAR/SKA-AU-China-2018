#  ===========================================================================
# This document provides information on how to use ASKAPsoft built on SHAO.
# Relevant modules have been built on the SHAO to facilitate 
# execution of ASKAPsoft application. You need to execute the 
# following to make use of the tools in the modules:

#  PART - A: Description of various components 
#
# 1. Modules to be loaded by Execution scripts (especially for slurm jobs):  
module use /home/askap/Software/modulefiles
module load askapsoft
module load askapdata 

# 2. Visualising images: 
module load casa

# 3. Example executing ASKAPsoft applications: 
# (Run the above commands)
executable name: selavy, cimager 
example data set: /home/ska_au_china_2018/askap_imaging/singleSource_continuum.ms 

Exercise 1: IMAGING

1. Generation code: generator_cimager.sh  
   Description: 
       
       i. generates the parset files for application
       ii. generates the config file for resource allocation and command generation 

   Location: 
       /home/ska_au_china_2018/askap_imaging/
   Type: 
       bash script

       * Currently the inputs are defined (by-hand)at the beginning of the script. But 
         the aim would be to get these parameters from meta-data services. 
       * The inputs are: 
                 i. Name and Location of visibility data
                 ii. Names for outputs (images and logs etc.) to ensure meaningful book-keeping 
                 iii. Number of processes required 
                 iv. Number of processes per node required. 
                 v. Others... 
   Outputs: 
       * parset for cimager 
       * configure file containing execution command
       * Updates the execution script "run_cimager.sh" 

2. Execute Application: run_cimager.sh 

   Location: /home/ska_au_china_2018/askap_imaging/
       Type: bash script
   Description: 
 
       * Executes ASKAPsoft application "cimager" 

   Output: 
       * Continuum images (location ?) 
       * Log file (location ?)
