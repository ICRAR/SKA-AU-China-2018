Interfaces from source-finding point-of-view

Input to overall pipeline:
      - trigger to start SF pipeline
      - get FileID to for image to search
      - e.g. runPipeline.sh FileID
      - In datamanagement - have kickoff_source_extractor.py that executes the wrapper script to kick off pipeline.

Interface with NGAS:
      - get an ASKAP image based on the file ID within NGAS
      - wget 159.226.233.198:7777/RETRIEVE?file_id=observations-2338-image_cubes-image.i.SB2338.cont.restored.fits

Sending to NGAS:
      - For sending the XML catalogue (e.g. called selavy-results.components.xml) to the archive
      - wget --post-file=selavy-results.components.xml --header "Content-Type: application/VOTABLE" 159.226.233.198:7777/ARCHIVE?filename=selavy-results.components.xml
      - check application type? 
      - QUESTION - should we interact directly with NGAS here? Probably for this purpose is fine.
