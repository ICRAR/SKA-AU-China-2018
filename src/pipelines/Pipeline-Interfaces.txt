Interfaces from source-finding point-of-view

Input to overall pipeline:
      - In datamanagement - have kickoff_source_extractor.py that executes the wrapper script to kick off pipeline.
      - In src/pipelines, have trigger script src/pipelines/trigger_pipeline.py:
usage: trigger_pipeline.py [-h] [--imglist IMG_LIST] [--parset PARSET_TPL]
                           [--lgfile LG_FILE]

Trigger a pipeline

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --imglist IMG_LIST   each line is an image path
  --parset PARSET_TPL  parset template file
  --lgfile LG_FILE     logical graph path

      - This will run Selavy on the image(s) provided in the IMG_LIST file.
      

Retrieving from NGAS:
      - Get an ASKAP image based on the file ID within NGAS, e.g.,
      - src/pipelines/ngas-get-files.py -f observations-2338-image_cubes-image.i.SB2338.cont.restored.fits

Sending to NGAS:
      - For sending the XML catalogue (e.g. called selavy-results.components.xml) to the archive
      - wget --post-file=selavy-results.components.xml --header "Content-Type: text/x-votable+xml" 159.226.233.198:7777/ARCHIVE?filename=selavy-results.components.xml
      - Suggested content-type (from WP3) is "text/x-votable+xml"
        - However, trying the above wget command failed with the
          following error:
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 400 Bad Request
