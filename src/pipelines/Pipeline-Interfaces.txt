Interfaces from source-finding point-of-view

Input to overall pipeline:
      - trigger to start SF pipeline
      - get FileID to for image to search
      - e.g. runPipeline.sh FileID
      - In datamanagement - have kickoff_source_extractor.py that executes the wrapper script to kick off pipeline.

Retrieving from NGAS:
      - Get an ASKAP image based on the file ID within NGAS, e.g.,
      - ./ngas-get-askap-image.py -f observations-2338-image_cubes-image.i.SB2338.cont.restored.fits

Sending to NGAS:
      - For sending the XML catalogue (e.g. called selavy-results.components.xml) to the archive
      - wget --post-file=selavy-results.components.xml --header "Content-Type: text/x-votable+xml" 159.226.233.198:7777/ARCHIVE?filename=selavy-results.components.xml
      - Suggested content-type (from WP3) is "text/x-votable+xml"
        - However, trying the above wget command failed with the
          following error:
        HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 400 Bad Request
        2018-04-11 11:35:42 ERROR 400: Bad Request.
