# Steps to get ASKAPsoft run on SHAO cluster
# Relevant modules have been build on the SHAO to facilitate 
# execution of ASKAPsoft application. You need to execute the 
# following to make use of the tools in the modules: 
module use /home/askap/Software/modulefiles
module load askapsoft
export AIPSPATH=/home/data1/askap_big_data/ASKAPsdp-0.20.3/Code/Base/accessors/current/

# For visualisation of casa/fits images: 
module load casa

# Some notes specific to executing the source-finder "selavy": 
# (Run the above commands)
executable name: selavy 
example data set: /home/askap/ska_big_data_workshop/data 
example selavy parset: /home/askap/ska_big_data_workshop/selavy.in 
example slurm file (needed to execute selavy using srun): /home/askap/ska_big_data_workshop/selavy.sbatch

# Execution command (from the working directory: /home/askap/ska_big_data_workshop): 
# The parset file "selavy.in" is expected in the current working directory. 
>sbatch selavy.sbatch
